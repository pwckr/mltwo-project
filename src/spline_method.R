# Comment from Downie:
# The spline smoothing uses just one predictor variable.
# I would like you to investigate at least 3 spline models using each time a
# different variable. Perhaps it makes sense to choose variables you think (in
# advance) will have the biggest non-linear effect on wine quality.

# evtl. PCA?
